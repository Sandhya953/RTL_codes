ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sandhya Jagarapu
ðŸš€ 100 Days of RTL - Verilog Challenge Hello VLSI enthusiasts! Welcome to my 100 Days of RTL repository.

Iâ€™m sandhya jagarapu, and this repo is a collection of my daily Verilog projects completed over 100 days. Using Xilinx ISE 14.7 and other tools, I practiced and mastered various digital design concepts, from simple gates to complex finite state machines.

Whatâ€™s Inside? Over 100 Verilog codes implementing diverse digital circuits Topics include combinational logic, sequential circuits, FSMs, counters, and much more A solid journey to strengthen RTL design and hardware modeling skills Why 100 Days of RTL? Practicing consistently for 100 days helped me deepen my understanding of hardware description languages, sharpen my coding skills, and prepare for challenges in VLSI design and FPGA development.

How to Use This Repo Feel free to explore the codes folder to find projects by day. Each code file is self-contained and commented to help learners understand the implementation.
